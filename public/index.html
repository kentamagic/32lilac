				Most of us are graduating in May, and we will be moving out of here, moving in to new cities, new rooms. We are always situating ourselves, geographically and conceptually and existentially. There is never a time when we are not in some place, or not living somewhere. <br><br>

				The short pitch is this: we are a group of Yale undergrads (artists, actors, writers) doing an art show at 32 Lilac Street. We move in on Wednesday and Thursday, and then you will be able to come visit us starting Friday.<br>

				I gave Becky the master bedroom. Jaime and Anna each have a bedroom to themselves. Jacqi’s got the sitting room with the skylight, and Zach is setting up in the kitchen. Martina is in the living room, Olivia is in the bathrooms, Kenta is in the basement, and Elif will be in the stairway.Control Group will be wandering around, doing miscellaneous household chores.<br>

				I mean, we’re not really a family. We are a motley crew of post-pubescent youth trying to do this project together. The outcome won’t suit everybody’s taste. Many people think an art show should just be paintings and photographs, flat things hanging on the walls.<br><br>
				It is really hard to organize an art show full of undergrads. Everyone is so busy. People don’t respond to emails. For example, last week, my senior thesis was due.<br><br>

				This is a strange kind of art show. Part community event, part selfish adolescent fantasy. What would we do if we had a whole house to ourselves? How would we fill it?<br>
				<br>
				It is as if the adults have left the house, and now we are here, expected to take care of ourselves, expected to take care of the house. “Just make sure the house doesn’t burn down,” said the parents to the babysitter. “You know how to reach us."<br><br>
				</p>	
			</div>
			<div class="headshot pink draggable">
				<p>				 
				There’s the sense of a total lack of supervision. We’re building forts, we’re cooking hamburgers, we’re trying on mom’s makeup. But even if the adults are somewhere else, the adults are among us.<br><br>We wander around the house, opening windows and turning on faucets. We put things in cabinets, we take things out of the refrigerator. We cut some vegetables. We fold some laundry.<br><br>We are slowly becoming the adult versions of ourselves by picking up our parents’ habits. We’ve got the hardware—the doors, the sinks, the closets full of clothes—but we have perhaps not figured out how to reside in a house that is not our home, that is not our parents’ home.</p>

					Using my own form as an index and an image-making device, I ask: how can we know what goes on inside us? How is the act of imaging the body, inside and out, inherently violent? How can we come to accept the unreliability of our perceptions and images of our bodies?</div>

				We’re almost-adults and almost-artists and almost-activists. <br><br>
				I think a lot of the work in this show feels somewhat uneasy and temporary: Are we welcome here? Are we allowed to do this?<br><br>
				This house was not intended to be a gallery, and it will never be an art gallery again. People will live here. Some family will move in with their beds, their lamps, their dressers, their cooking utensils. <br><br>
				We are here this weekend, but we are not allowed to damage the walls. On Monday, we will move out of this house. And then in a few weeks or a few months, a family will move in to fill the space. We will leave no trace. Good thing we will leave no trace.<br><br>
